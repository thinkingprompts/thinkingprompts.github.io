  <h2>Mental Models</h2>
  <dl>    
      <dt>&#8226 80/20 rule</dt>
          <dd>-The 80-20 rule maintains that 80% of outcomes comes from 20% of causes. It help identify inputs that are potentially the most productive and make them the priority.</dd>
      <dt>&#8226 Theory of constraints</dt>
          <dd>-Any manageable system is limited in achieving more of its goals by a very small number of constraints. It help identify the constraint and restructure the rest of the organization around it.</dd>
      <dt>&#8226 First principles thinking</dt>
          <dd>-It is a process to remove assumptions, determine what can be proven with certainty, reduce a process/situation down to the fundamental truths, and construct your view from there.</dd>
      <dt>&#8226 Occam's razor</dt>
          <dd>-The simplest answer — that is, the answer that requires the fewest assumptions — is generally the correct one.</dd>
      <dt>&#8226 Hock principle</dt>
          <dd>-Simple, clear purpose and principles give rise to complex and intelligent behaviour. Complex rules and regulations 
            give rise to simple and stupid behaviour.</dd>
      <dt>&#8226 Interest-based thinkinging</dt>
      <dt>&#8226 Inversion</dt>
          <dd>-Instead of thinking about what you should do to achieve a particular outcome, inversion thinking involves thinking about what not to do to avoid a negative result. This approach is based on the idea that identifying and avoiding mistakes is often easier than identifying and following the correct path.</dd>
      <dt>&#8226 Thought experiment</dt>
          <dd>-An imagined sequence of events that is used to illustrate or investigate the consequences of a given action or condition.</dd>
      <dt>&#8226 Multi-disciplinary thinking</dt>
          <dd>-It involves drawing from multiple disciplines to redefine problems outside of normal boundaries and reach solutions based on a new understanding of complex situations.</dd>

          <dd>-Lollapalooza Tendency—The Tendency to Get Extreme Consequences from Confluences of Psychology Tendencies Acting in Favor of a Particular Outcome</dd>
      <dt>&#8226 Third story</dt>
          <dd>-Instead of considering only two sides of a story, the third story makes you look at the situation as an impartial observer and see it for what it really is. It helps you build empathy.</dd>
      <dt>&#8226 Thinking gray</dt>
          <dd>-You may think about issues in terms of black and white, but the truth is somewhere in between, a shade of gray.</dd>
      <dt>&#8226 Devil's advocate position</dt>
          <dd>-To take an opposing position for the sake of argument</dd>
      <dt>&#8226 Hanlon's razor</dt>
          <dd>-When assessing people’s actions, you should not assume that they acted out of a desire to cause harm, as long as there is a reasonable alternative explanation.</dd>

    <dt>&#8226 Crossing the chasm</dt>  

    <dt>&#8226 The map is not the territory</dt>  
        <dd>-The map of reality is not reality. Even the best maps are imperfect. That’s because they are reductions of what they represent. </dd>
    <dt>&#8226 Circle of competence</dt>
        <dd>-Know what you understand and where you have an edge over others. Know where your knowledge is lacking, where you are vulnerable and where you can improve</dd>
    <dt>&#8226 Second-order thinking</dt>  
        <dd>-Consider the actions, their immediate reactions, and subsequent effects of those reactions</dd>
    <dt>&#8226 Probabilistic thinking</dt> 
        <dd>-Estimate using some tools of math and logic, the likelihood of any specific outcome coming to pass</dd>
    <dt>&#8226 Relativity</dt>  
        <dd>-An observer cannot truly understand a system of which he himself is a part</dd>
    <dt>&#8226 Reciprocity</dt> 
        <dd>-If you pusd on an object, it pushes back with equivalent force</dd>
    <dt>&#8226 Thermodyanmics</dt> 
        <dd>-They describe a world in which useful energy is constantly being lost, and energy cannot be created or destroyed.</dd>
    <dt>&#8226 Inertia</dt> 
        <dd>-An object in motion with a certain vector wants to continue moving in that direction unless acted upon.</dd>
    <dt>&#8226 Friction and viscosity</dt>  
        <dd>-Both friction and viscosity describe the difficulty of movement.</dd>
    <dt>&#8226 Velocity</dt> 
        <dd>-Velocity is speed plus vector: how fast something gets somewhere.</dd>

        <dd>-With a small amount of input force, we can make a great output force through leverage.</dd>
    <dt>&#8226 Activation energy</dt>
        <dd>-A chemical reaction requires the input of a critical level of “activation energy” in order to get a reaction started.</dd>
    <dt>&#8226 Catalyst</dt> 
        <dd>-A catalyst either kick-starts or maintains a chemical reaction but isn’t itself a reactant.</dd>
    <dt>&#8226 Alloying</dt> 
        <dd>-When we combine various elements, we create new substances, which can be far stronger than expected</dd>
    <dt>&#8226 Natural selection and extinction</dt>  
        <dd>-Species evolve through random mutation and differential survival rates</dd>
    <dt>&#8226 Adaption and the red queen effect</dt>
        <dd>-Species tend to adapt to their surroundings in order to survive. The evolution-by-natural-selection model leads to something of an arms race among species competing for limited resources.</dd>
    <dt>&#8226 Ecosystems</dt>  
        <dd>-An ecosystem describes any group of organisms coexisting with the natural world</dd>
    <dt>&#8226 Niches</dt> 
        <dd>-Most organisms find a niche: a method of competing and behaving for survival. Usually, a species will select a niche for which it is best adapted.</dd>
    <dt>&#8226 Self-Preservation</dt> 
        <dd>-the self-preservation instinct is strong in all organisms and can cause violent, erratic, and/or destructive behavior for those around them</dd>
    <dt>&#8226 Replication</dt>  
      <dd>-A fundamental building block of diverse biological life is high-fidelity replication.</dd>
    <dt>&#8226 Cooperation</dt> 
        <dd>-Competition tends to describe most biological systems, but cooperation at various levels is just as important a dynamic.</dd>
    <dt>&#8226 Hierarchical  Organization</dt>   
        <dd>-Most complex biological organisms have an innate feel for how they should organize. While not all of them end up in hierarchical structures, many do, especially in the animal kingdom.</dd>
    <dt>&#8226 Incentives</dt> 
        <dd>-All creatures respond to incentives to keep themselves alive. This is the basic insight of biology. </dd>

    <dt>&#8226 Equilibrium</dt>   
    <dt>&#8226 Bottlenecks</dt> 
    <dt>&#8226 Scale</dt>  
        <dd>-One of the most important principles of systems is that they are sensitive to scale. Properties (or behaviors) tend to change when you scale them up or down. </dd>
    <dt>&#8226 Margin of Safety</dt> 
        <dd>-engineers have also developed the habit of adding a margin for error into all calculations. </dd>
    <dt>&#8226 Churn</dt>
        <dd>-A constant figure is periodically lost and must be replaced before any new figures are added over the top.</dd>
    <dt>&#8226 Algorithms</dt> 
        <dd>-an algorithm is generally an automated set of rules or a “blueprint” leading a series of steps or actions resulting in a desired outcome, and often stated in the form of a series of “If → Then” statements. </dd>
    <dt>&#8226 Critical mass</dt> 
        <dd>-A system becomes critical when it is about to jump discretely from one phase to another.</dd>
    <dt>&#8226 Emergence</dt> 
        <dd>-Higher-level behavior tends to emerge from the interaction of lower-order components. The result is frequently not linear – not a matter of simple addition – but rather non-linear, or exponential. </dd>
    <dt>&#8226 Irreducibility</dt> 
        <dd>-We find that in most systems there are irreducible quantitative properties, such as complexity, minimums, time, and length. Below the irreducible level, the desired result simply does not occur. </dd>
    <dt>&#8226 Law of diminishing returns</dt> 
        <dd>-Related to scale, most important real-world results are subject to an eventual decrease of incremental value. </dd>

    <dt>&#8226 Creative Destruction</dt> 
    <dt>&#8226 Comparative Advantage</dt>
        <dd>-Two individuals, firms, or countries could benefit from trading with one another even if one of them was better at everything. Comparative advantage is best seen as an applied opportunity cost</dd>
    <dt>&#8226 Specialization (Pin Factory)</dt>  
        <dd>-Scottish economist, Adam Smith, highlighted the advantages gained in a free-market system by specialization.</dd>
    <dt>&#8226 Seizing the Middle</dt> 
        <dd>-In chess, the winning strategy is usually to seize control of the middle of the board, so as to maximize the potential moves that can be made and control the movement of the maximal number of pieces.</dd>
    <dt>&#8226 Trademarks, Patents, and Copyrights</dt> 
    <dt>&#8226 Double-Entry Bookkeeping</dt> 
        <dd>-The double-entry system requires that every entry, such as income, also be entered into another corresponding account.</dd>
    <dt>&#8226 Utility (Marginal, Diminishing, Increasing)</dt>
        <dd>-The usefulness of additional units of any good tends to vary with scale</dd>
    <dt>&#8226 Bribery</dt> 
        <dd>-The concept of bribery is central to human systems: Given the chance, it is often easier to pay a certain agent to look the other way than to follow the rules.</dd>
    <dt>&#8226 Arbitrage</dt> 
        <dd>-Given two markets selling an identical good, an arbitrage exists if the good can profitably be bought in one market and sold at a profit in the other. </dd>
