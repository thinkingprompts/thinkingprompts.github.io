  <dl>    
      <dt>* 80/20 rule</dt>
          <db>-The 80-20 rule maintains that 80% of outcomes comes from 20% of causes. It help identify inputs that 
            are potentially the most productive and make them the priority.</db>
      <dt>* Theory of constraints</dt>
          <db>-Any manageable system is limited in achieving more of its goals by a very small number of constraints. It help
            identify the constraint and restructure the rest of the organization around it.</db>
      <dt>* First principles thinking</dt>
          <db>-It is a process to remove assumptions, determine what can be proven with certainty, reduce a process/situation
            down to the fundamental truths, and construct your view from there.</db>
      <dt>* Occam's razor</dt>
          <db>-the simplest answer — that is, the answer that requires the fewest assumptions — is generally the correct one.</db>
      <dt>* Hock principle</dt>
          <db>-Simple, clear purpose and principles give rise to complex and intelligent behaviour. Complex rules and regulations 
            give rise to simple and stupid behaviour.</db>

          <dd>-Frame of reference, Framing, Nudging, Anchoring, Filter bubble, Echo chambers</dd>

          <dd>-Veil of ignorance, Birth lottery, Just world hypothesis, Victum-blame, Learned helplessness </dd>  
      <dt>* Devil's advocate position</dt>
      <dt>* Hanlon's razor</dt>
