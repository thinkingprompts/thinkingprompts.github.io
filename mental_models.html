  <dl>    
      <dt>&#8226 80/20 rule</dt>
          <dd>-The 80-20 rule maintains that 80% of outcomes comes from 20% of causes. It help identify inputs that are potentially the most productive and make them the priority.</dd>
      <dt>&#8226 Theory of constraints</dt>
          <dd>-Any manageable system is limited in achieving more of its goals by a very small number of constraints. It help identify the constraint and restructure the rest of the organization around it.</dd>
      <dt>&#8226 First principles thinking</dt>
          <dd>-It is a process to remove assumptions, determine what can be proven with certainty, reduce a process/situation down to the fundamental truths, and construct your view from there.</dd>
      <dt>&#8226 Occam's razor</dt>
          <dd>-The simplest answer — that is, the answer that requires the fewest assumptions — is generally the correct one.</dd>
      <dt>&#8226 Hock principle</dt>
          <dd>-Simple, clear purpose and principles give rise to complex and intelligent behaviour. Complex rules and regulations 
            give rise to simple and stupid behaviour.</dd>
      <dt>&#8226 Interest-based thinkinging</dt>
      <dt>&#8226 Inversion</dt>
          <dd>-Instead of thinking about what you should do to achieve a particular outcome, inversion thinking involves thinking about what not to do to avoid a negative result. This approach is based on the idea that identifying and avoiding mistakes is often easier than identifying and following the correct path.</dd>
      <dt>&#8226 Thought experiment</dt>
          <dd>-An imagined sequence of events that is used to illustrate or investigate the consequences of a given action or condition.</dd>
      <dt>&#8226 Multi-disciplinary thinking</dt>
          <dd>It involves drawing from multiple disciplines to redefine problems outside of normal boundaries and reach solutions based on a new understanding of complex situations.</dd>
      <dt>&#8226 Psychology of human misjudgement: fallacies and biases</dt>
      <dt>&#8226 Third story</dt>
      <dt>&#8226 Thinking gray</dt>
      <dt>&#8226 Devil's advocate position</dt>
          <dd>-To take an opposing position for the sake of argument</dd>
      <dt>&#8226 Hanlon's razor</dt>
          <dd>-When assessing people’s actions, you should not assume that they acted out of a desire to cause harm, as long as there is a reasonable alternative explanation.</dd>
      <dt>&#8226 De-risking</dt>
      <dt>&#8226 Antifragile</dt>
      <dt>&#8226 Minimum viable product</dt>
