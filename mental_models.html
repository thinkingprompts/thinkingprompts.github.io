  <dl>    
      <dt>&#8226 80/20 rule</dt>
          <dd>-The 80-20 rule maintains that 80% of outcomes comes from 20% of causes. It help identify inputs that are potentially the most productive and make them the priority.</dd>
      <dt>&#8226 Theory of constraints</dt>
          <dd>-Any manageable system is limited in achieving more of its goals by a very small number of constraints. It help identify the constraint and restructure the rest of the organization around it.</dd>
      <dt>&#8226 First principles thinking</dt>
          <dd>-It is a process to remove assumptions, determine what can be proven with certainty, reduce a process/situation down to the fundamental truths, and construct your view from there.</dd>
      <dt>&#8226 Occam's razor</dt>
          <dd>-The simplest answer — that is, the answer that requires the fewest assumptions — is generally the correct one.</dd>
      <dt>&#8226 Hock principle</dt>
          <dd>-Simple, clear purpose and principles give rise to complex and intelligent behaviour. Complex rules and regulations 
            give rise to simple and stupid behaviour.</dd>
      <dt></dt>
      <dt>&#8226 Interest-based thinkinging</dt>
      <dt>&#8226 Via negativa</dt>
          <dd>Via negativa is essentially the study of what not to do. List things that you do not want to do, and try to avoid them.</dd>
      <dt>&#8226 Inversion</dt>
      <dt>&#8226 Relativity</dt>
      <dt>&#8226 Velocity vs speed</dt>
      <dt></dt>
      <dt>&#8226 Thought experiment</dt>
          <dd>-De-risking</dd>
      <dt>&#8226 Multi-disciplinary thinking</dt>
      <dt>&#8226 Psychology of human misjudgement: fallacies and biases</dt>
      <dt>&#8226 Exponential result</dt>
      <dt></dt>
      <dt>&#8226 Antifragile</dt>
      <dt>&#8226 Minimum viable product</dt>
      <dt></dt>
      <dt>&#8226 Third story</dt>
          <dd>-Frame of reference, Framing, Nudging, Anchoring, Filter bubble, Echo chambers</dd>
      <dt>&#8226 Thinking gray</dt>
          <dd>-Veil of ignorance, Birth lottery, Just world hypothesis, Victum-blame, Learned helplessness </dd>  
      <dt>&#8226 Devil's advocate position</dt>
      <dt>&#8226 Hanlon's razor</dt>
          <dd>-do not attribute to malice if it is adaquately explained by carelessness</dd>
