  <h2>Mental Models</h2>
  <dl>    
      <dt>* 80/20 rule</dt>
          <dd>-The 80-20 rule maintains that 80% of outcomes comes from 20% of causes. It help identify inputs that are potentially the most productive and make them the priority.</dd>
      <dt>* Theory of constraints</dt>
          <dd>-Any manageable system is limited in achieving more of its goals by a very small number of constraints. It help identify the constraint and restructure the rest of the organization around it.</dd>
      <dt>* First principles thinking</dt>
          <dd>-It is a process to remove assumptions, determine what can be proven with certainty, reduce a process/situation down to the fundamental truths, and construct your view from there.</dd>
      <dt>* Occam's razor</dt>
          <dd>-The simplest answer — that is, the answer that requires the fewest assumptions — is generally the correct one.</dd>
      <dt>* Hock principle</dt>
          <dd>-Simple, clear purpose and principles give rise to complex and intelligent behaviour. Complex rules and regulations 
            give rise to simple and stupid behaviour.</dd>

      <dt>* Interest-based counting</dt>
      <dt>* Via negativa</dt>
      <dt>* Inversion</dt>
      <dt>* Relativity</dt>
      <dt>* Velocity vs speed</dt>

      <dt>* Thought experiment</dt>
          <dd>-De-risking</dd>
      <dt>* Multi-disciplinary thinking</dt>
      <dt>* Psychology of human misjudgement: fallacies and biases</dt>
      <dt>* Exponential result</dt>

      <dt>* Third story</dt>
          <dd>-Frame of reference, Framing, Nudging, Anchoring, Filter bubble, Echo chambers</dd>
      <dt>* Thinking gray</dt>
          <dd>-Veil of ignorance, Birth lottery, Just world hypothesis, Victum-blame, Learned helplessness </dd>  
      <dt>* Devil's advocate position</dt>
      <dt>* Hanlon's razor</dt>
          <dd>-do not attribute to malice if it is adaquately explained by carelessness</dd>
